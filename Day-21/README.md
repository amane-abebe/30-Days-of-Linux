# Day 21: Introduction to Bash Scripting

## Objective
To transition from manual command entry to automation by creating executable Bash scripts.

## Key Concepts Learned
- **The Shebang (#!/bin/bash)**: The header that defines the script's interpreterScript Permissionsns**: Using chmod +x to turn a text file into a runnable programAutomated Reportingng**: Combining multiple commands (date, df, whoami) into a single execution.

## Why this is importantCloud Engineering:g:** Automation is the core of "Infrastructure as Code." Cloud Engineers write scripts to automatically set up servers, install software, and verify that everything is running correctlyCybersecurity:y:** Security professionals write scripts to "brute force" check their own systems for weaknesses, or to automatically collect logs from a computer that might have been hacked.

## Lab Reflection
Today I wrote my first official Bash script. Instead of typing three separate commands to check my system health, I can now run a single file. This is the first step toward managing thousands of servers simultaneously.
