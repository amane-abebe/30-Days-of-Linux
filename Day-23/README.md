# Day 23: Conditional Logic (If/Else Statements)

## Objective
To learn how to use logical "If/Else" statements to allow scripts to make decisions based on file existence or user input.

## Key Concepts Learned
- If/Then/Else: The structure used to branch script logic.
- **File Testing (-f)**: A conditional flag used to check if a specific file exists on the system.
- **The fi Keyword**: The proper way to close a conditional block in Bash.

## Why this is imporCloud Engineering:ering:** A Cloud Engineer writes "Health Check" scripts. For example: "If the disk space is more than 90%, send an alert to the team." This prevents servers from crasCybersecurity:urity:** Security scripts often check for the existence of "Malicious Files" or "Backdoors." If a specific suspicious file is found, the script can automatically delete it or isolate the machine from the network.

## Lab Reflection
Today I gave my automation a "brain." I learned how to check for the existence of a file before performing an action. This prevents errors (like trying to read a file that isn't there) and allows for much more complex automation tasks.
