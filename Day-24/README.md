# Day 24: Loops (For and While)

## Objective
To master the use of loops to automate repetitive tasks across multiple files or conditions.

## Key Concepts Learned
- For Loops: Iterating through a list of items (like files in a directory).
- While Loops: Repeating a task as long as a specific condition remains true.
- Bulk Operations: Using a loop to perform the same action (copying/renaming) on many files simultaneously.

## Why this is important:
- Cloud Engineering: Imagine you have 500 servers. A Cloud Engineer uses a for loop to log into every server and install a security update. Doing this manually would take days; a script does it in minutes.
- Cybersecurity: A security professional might use a loop to "fuzz" a website, testing hundreds of different passwords or subdomains to see which ones are vulnerable.

## Lab Reflection
Today I learned how to handle "Bulk" tasks. I wrote a script that automatically identifies files in a folder and creates backup copies of them. This is the foundation of high-level automation—treating many objects as a single task.
