# Day 25: Bash Functions & Modular Scripting

## Objective
To learn how to organize complex scripts into reusable "functions" to improve code maintainability and professional structure.

## Key Concepts Learned
- Function Declaration: Grouping commands into named blocks for easy reuse.
- Code Modularity: Breaking a large task (System Audit) into smaller, manageable parts (Security, Storage, User checks).
- Automation Workflow: Designing a script that follows a logical sequence of execution.

## Why this is important:
- Cloud Engineering: A Cloud Engineer doesn't just run one command; they manage entire infrastructures. Functions allow them to create "modules" for different tasks like "Database Backup," "Log Rotation," and "Server Update" within a single automation script.
- Cybersecurity: When a security analyst investigates a system, they need to run a series of checks (Network, Users, Files). Modular scripts allow them to run specific "Security Functions" quickly and reliably without errors.

## Lab Reflection
Today I moved from writing simple linear scripts to writing modular programs. I built a "System Audit Tool" that uses three distinct functions to analyze the machine. This is the foundation of building professional-grade automation software in Linux.
