# Day 30: Final Capstone Project - The System Guardian

## Objective
To synthesize 30 days of Linux learning into a single, comprehensive automation tool that performs system health monitoring, security auditing, and data backup.

## Project Features
- Automated Health Monitoring: Captures RAM and Disk usage data.
- Security Forensic Audit: Parses system logs for failed login attempts and audits open network ports.
- Data Archiving: Automatically bundles and compresses study materials for backup.
- Professional Logging: Records all activities with timestamps for administrative review.

## Reflection on the 30-Day Journey
This project marks the completion of my 30-day "Linux Zero-to-Hero" journey. I have successfully moved from basic navigation to advanced system administration and Bash scripting. I now possess the foundational skills required to pursue a career as a Cloud Engineer or Cybersecurity Analyst.

## Total Skills Acquired:
- File System Management & Permissions
- Networking & SSH Security
- System Monitoring & Process Control
- Advanced Text Processing (Grep, Awk, Sed)
- Automation with Bash Scripting (Loops, Functions, Logic)
- Containerization with Docker
- Security Auditing with Lynis & UFW Firewall
